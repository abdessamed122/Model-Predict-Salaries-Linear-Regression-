# Predict Salaries using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Description
This project builds a machine learning model using **Linear Regression** to predict salaries based on years of experience. The model learns from past salary data to make accurate predictions for new inputs.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of the following features:
- **Years of Experience** (Independent Variable)
- **Salary** (Dependent Variable - Target)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas (for data manipulation)  
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)  
- Scikit-Learn (for model training and evaluation)  

## 📈 Model Overview
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean the dataset.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the data to understand trends.  
3. **Model Training**: Train a **Linear Regression** model using Scikit-Learn.  
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate performance using **R² Score**.  
5. **Visualization**: Plot data points and the regression line.

## 📌 Results
The trained model provides salary predictions based on years of experience. It can be improved with **more features, hyperparameter tuning, or advanced regression techniques**.

## 📝 Future Enhancements
- Experiment with different regression models (e.g., Polynomial Regression)
- Use additional features (e.g., education level, job title) for better predictions
- Deploy as a web app using Flask or FastAPI
